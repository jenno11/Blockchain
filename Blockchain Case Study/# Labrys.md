#  Labrys

Labrys is a blockchain technology company based in Brisbane, Australia. They help their clients understand where and how they can access and utilise blockchain to their advantage.
 
The Labrys team collaborates by sharing and brainstorming to develop new, creative, and innovative ideas. They take these new and experimental blockchain concepts and bring them to fruition, creating real-world business solutions. The  team loves taking part in these solutions and values the opportunity to make an impact in how blockchain is used.
 
The Labrys designers, developers, and consultants can help startups, existing businesses or individuals leverage the benefits of existing blockchain or to create completely new protocols with blockchain.

# The Process
## Idea
Labry's have a varied clientele because they create solutions for and optimise just about anything. From a small-scale, simple application for finding a restaurant to a complex personal finance blockchain — bring them any idea and we’ll turn it into something real.

## Workshops
Labrys consultants will evaluate the business and collaborate with the client to work out how and where distributed ledgers can optimise the processes. Labry's define how they measure success going forward and lay out the expected timeline and strategy.

## Solution Design
Labry's engineers will design the architecture of the client's new system. Using design-thinking, thorough research, and their extensive knowledge of blockchain, they will create the clients customised framework. Then, the developers develop and deploy the clients new product, service or platform. Ensuring rigorous testing is performed for quality assurance.

## Proof of Concept
Jumping in and fully developing a concept can be costly and risky. Labry's create low cost prototypes to demonstrate the clients product concept to them and any other key stakeholders early on. That way, the clients get to see what it looks like, how it functions, and what it can do for the client and their concept.

## Product Launch
The client then receives their brand new blockchain enabled solution, brilliance guaranteed. Labry's will take the client on a tour of their finished product and seamlessly transition their existing data and information through to their new system.
